# FORTRESS EDITION  
Secure Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)  
Investor Deck – €200 Million Series Seed  
December 2025  

### Title Slide  
FORTRESS  
The World’s First Provably Secure Platform-as-a-Service  
EAL7+ Formally Verified Microkernel | Sovereign Data Centres (Germany + UAE) | Zero-Trust by Mathematical Proof  

“Software is eating the world.  
We are building the vault that protects it.”  

### The Problem  
Every major breach in the last five years (SolarWinds, Log4j, MOVEit, Change Healthcare, CrowdStrike, Salt Typhoon) started with a single compromised application or supply-chain package.  
Current PaaS / cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, Heroku, Vercel, Fly.io, Render) all run on the same 50-year-old Linux kernel architecture with 25 million lines of C code and no mathematical guarantee of correctness.  
Nation-state attackers know this. Central banks, defense ministries, and critical infrastructure operators cannot trust them.

### The FORTRESS Solution  
A complete end-to-end secure PaaS built from the ground up on a formally verified microkernel (EAL7+ Common Criteria) that mathematically proves absence of entire classes of vulnerabilities.  

Core Technical Pillars  
1. Provably Correct Kernel – seL4-derived or custom microkernel with full formal verification (Wyomatix/TrustInSoft class)  
2. Immutable Root-of-Trust – Every container, VM, and CI/CD runner executes inside a mathematically isolated compartment  
3. AI-Driven Secure Supply Chain – Real-time static + dynamic analysis of every commit, every dependency, every container image using on-prem GPU clusters and proprietary agents  
4. Sovereign Infrastructure – Owned Tier-4 capable cages in Frankfurt (DE) and Dubai (UAE) with German/UAE staff and encryption keys never leaving jurisdiction  
5. Single Pane of Glass – Beautiful enterprise UI with live proof status, ZFS health, SELinux/AVM status, and formal verification badges

Conservative Year 3 revenue target with €200 M raise: €380 M ARR (15 fortress customers average €25 M each)

### Use of Proceeds – €200 Million  
| Category                                 | Amount (€M) | %    | Details |
|------------------------------------------|-------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Formal Verification & EAL7+ Certification| 124         | 62%  | Wyomatix-class lab, full proof of microkernel + core user-space |
| Sovereign Data Centre Build-out          | 39          | 19.5%| Owned cages Frankfurt + Dubai, HSMs, 100 Gbps private lambda |
| World-Class Team (128 heads, 36 months)  | 66          | 17%  | Berlin/Dubai campus, top 1 % global talent in formal methods, kernel, AI |
| On-Prem GPU Clusters & AI Security R&D  | 8           | 4%   | Proprietary supply-chain analysis engines |
| Legal, Compliance, Go-to-Market          | 13          | 6.5% | BSI/ANSSI sponsorship, UAE NESA, first 3 reference wins |
| Working Capital & Contingency            | 50          | 11%  | 20 % buffer + 18-month runway post-MVP |
| **Total**                                | **200**     | 100% | |

### Milestones – 36 Months to Profitability  
| Quarter | Milestone |
|--------|------------|
| Q1–Q2 2026 | Company founded, core formal methods team hired, microkernel design freeze |
| Q4 2026    | First complete mathematical proof of kernel isolation properties |
| Q2 2027    | BSI/ANSSI site visit – formal EAL7+ evaluation begins |
| Q4 2027    | First sovereign cage online (Frankfurt) |
| Q2 2028    | EAL7+ certificate issued – first customer pilot (German grid operator) |
| Q4 2028    | Dubai cage online, second pilot (UAE government entity) |
| Q4 2029    | Positive EBITDA – 8 paying fortress customers |

### Why Now  
- The EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and UAE NESA frameworks go live 2025–2027 and explicitly demand “highest assurance” for critical providers  
- No civilian cloud provider on earth has EAL7+ today  
- Nation-state attacks have made “good enough” security politically unacceptable  

### The Ask  
€200 million Series Seed at a €800 million pre-money valuation  
Led by sovereign funds, defense-tech VCs, and strategic corporates who need this capability yesterday.

We are not building another cloud.  
We are building the only cloud that central banks and defense ministries are allowed to use.

Let’s talk.
